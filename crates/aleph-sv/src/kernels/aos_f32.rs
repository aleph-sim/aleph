//! Single-precision (`Complex<f32>`) AoS gate kernels (P2-08).
//!
//! Scalar f32 kernels cover every gate type (correctness on any circuit
//! and on non-AVX-512 hosts); f32 AVX-512 kernels accelerate the fused
//! hot-types the optimized pipeline emits. Mirrors `kernels::aos` per the
//! f64→f32 substitution rules in the P2-08 plan; the FP64 path is untouched.
